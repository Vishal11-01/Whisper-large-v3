# Project - Audio Transcription and Summarization with FastAPI using Whisper-large-v3
Audio Transcription and Summarization with FastAPI

Objective:
  
  You are tasked with developing a system that handles audio files by transcribing them, summarizing the 
  content, extracting timestamps, and saving the results locally. Additionally, you will implement a FastAPI 
  server to handle endpoints for this process.

Requirements:
  1. Transcription: Utilize the whisper-large-v3 model from OpenAI to transcribe the audio file 
  provided. Implement this using asynchronous endpoints in FastAPI to handle potentially large 
  audio files efficiently. Ensure the transcription handles common audio formats such 
  as .wav, .mp3, etc.
  2. Summarization: Use any suitable summarization model to generate a concise summary of the 
  transcribed text from the audio file.
  3. Timestamp Extraction: Extract timestamps or time intervals from the audio file where key 
  events or changes in content occur. These timestamps should be correlated with the 
  transcription
